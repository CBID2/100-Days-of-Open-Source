# 100DaysOfOSS Progress Tracker

##  Day 1 

- **Project**: Codecademy Docs 
- **Description of Project**: Codecademy Docs is a community-driven reference that can people can use when learning how to code or developing other tech skills.
- **Goals**: I wanted to grow my documentation skills, so I decided to improve on an entry I started writing.  
- **Tasks completed**: 
The reviewer suggested that I add some text in the syntax template I created, so I used Percentage Complete so people can gain a better understanding of how to use the progress element in their projects. I also added screenshots of the coding examples I created readers can see how the progress bar looks in a browser.   
- **Challenges faced**: 
- Uploading the images: I had trouble linking the screenshots to my entry
- Making the code snippets distinctive: I wanted the second example to be different and intermediate, so that people who quickly learned the syntax be engaged in the syntax.     
- Passing one of the code tests: 
- **Resources used**: 
- [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/progress) 
-  [Codepen](https://codepen.io/)

**Note:** It takes two approvals for entries to be merged, so I will check in later this week or tomorrow for updates. 
- **OpenSauced Highlight**: [Term Entry: `<progress>`](https://github.com/Codecademy/docs/pull/2842)
