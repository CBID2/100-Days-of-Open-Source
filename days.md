# 100DaysOfOSS Progress Tracker

## Day 1

- **Project**: [Codecademy Docs](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs)
- **Description of Project**: Codecademy Docs is a community-driven reference that can people can use when learning how to code or developing other tech skills.
- **Goals**: I wanted to grow my documentation skills, so I decided to improve on an entry I started writing.  
- **Tasks completed**:
The reviewer suggested that I add some text in the syntax template I created, so I used Percentage Complete so people can gain a better understanding of how to use the progress element in their projects. I also added screenshots of the coding examples I created readers can see how the progress bar looks in a browser.
- **Challenges faced**:
- Uploading the images: I had trouble linking the screenshots to my entry
- Making the code snippets distinctive: I wanted the second example to be different and intermediate so that people who quickly learned the syntax be engaged in the entry.
- Passing one of the code tests:
- **Resources used**:
- [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/progress)
- [Codepen](https://codepen.io/)

**Note:** It takes two approvals for entries to be merged, so I will check in later this week or tomorrow for updates.

- **OpenSauced Highlight**: [Term Entry: `<progress>`](https://github.com/Codecademy/docs/pull/2842)

## Day 2

**Update**: I got a second review on my PR for Codeacademy Docs. I just needed to revise some typos and use one of the examples I created to make it more applicable to how developers and tech professionals who code actually use this element in their daily work.
Want to see more, check out [the previous journal entry](https://github.com/CBID2/100-Days-of-Open-Source/blob/main/day-1-and-2.md#day-1).

- **Project**: [LinksHub](https://www.linkshub.dev/)

- **Description**:  I co-maintain this project with Rupali Haldiya. It's a website that provides developers and other tech professionals with free resources to learn new or improve their tech skills.

- **Tasks completed**:
- Reviewed Pull Requests from contributors

- **Challenges faced**:
- One of the major issues I faced is solving merge conflicts. At first, I tried opening the Merge Conflict Editor in VS Code, but that did not work. So, I tried doing it in GitHub, but that led to a deployment failure warning. So, I copied the JSON file into a JSON file validator for context and then used Bard for more assistance. This is a skill that I want to improve on as the challenge progresses.

- **Resources used**:
- [Bard](https://support.google.com/bard/answer/13275745?hl=en&ref_topic=13194540&sjid=4377171688044085065-NA )
- [JSON Format Validator](https://elmah.io/tools/json-formatter/)

- **OpenSauced Highlight**: [Reviewed PR](https://github.com/rupali-codes/LinksHub/pull/1363)

## Day 3

- **Project(s)**: [The Good Docs Project](https://thegooddocsproject.dev/about/) and [OpenSauced](https://opensauced.pizza/about)
- **Description**:  The Good Docs Project is a group of technical writers of all backgrounds that work diligently to provide people with the necessary tools to create high-quality documentation for their products. OpenSauced is a platform with a mission to help people in tech to have an engaging experience with the open source community.
- **Tasks completed**:
- GDP: Create a Merge Request for my troubleshooting template
- OpenSauced: Submit a pull request that adds subfolders to the Chrome Extension section of the company's product documentation.
- **Challenges faced**:
- GDP: It took me a while to work with GitLab. I eventually got over it by reading the website's documentation and installing their workflow extension for VS Code.
- OpenSauced: At first, I did not know how to go about adding the subfolders, but I decided to experiment and do a little research, and I eventually created the Pull request. It's still a work in progress.  
- **Resources used in GDP**:
- [Fork a repository]( https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/forking_workflow.html)

- **Project**: [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web)

- **Description**: This is the site developers and other people in tech  reference to for their coding projects. For this project, I wanted to improve the table in [the accesskey chapter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/accesskey). Here's [the issue](https://github.com/mdn/content/issues/25608) for more context.

- **Tasks completed**:
- I managed to place the values
- I also got my first review

- **Challenges faced**:
- Reformatting the table: I had trouble with placing each entry in a cell. Hopefully, I can solve it by Day 5 or 6.

- **Resources used**:
- [Table Basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Tables/Basics)
- [Accessibility features in Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/accessibility-features-firefox?s=access+key&as=s&redirectslug=Accessibility&redirectlocale=en-US#w_html-access-keys)

For LinksHub, I wanted to review and merge some PRs. In contrast, I wanted to revise and get my pull request for MDN Web Docs merged. 

- **Tasks completed**: 
- LinkHub: I reviewed and merged two PRs. 
- MDN: I revised my PR got it merged 

- **Challenges faced**: For MDN, I struggled with reformatting the table. So I worked with the reviewer and managed to fix it. 
- **Resources used**: Nothing this time. Just the power of collaboration.
