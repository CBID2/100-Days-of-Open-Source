# 100DaysOfOSS Progress Tracker

## Day 1

- **Project**: [Codecademy Docs](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs)
- **Description of Project**: Codecademy Docs is a community-driven reference that can people can use when learning how to code or developing other tech skills.
- **Goals**: I wanted to grow my documentation skills, so I decided to improve on an entry I started writing.  
- **Tasks completed**:
The reviewer suggested that I add some text in the syntax template I created, so I used Percentage Complete so people can gain a better understanding of how to use the progress element in their projects. I also added screenshots of the coding examples I created so readers can see how the progress bar looks in a browser.
- **Challenges faced**:
- Uploading the images: I had trouble linking the screenshots to my entry
- Making the code snippets distinctive: I wanted the second example to be different and intermediate so that people who quickly learned the syntax be engaged in the entry.
- Passing one of the code tests:
- **Resources used**:
- [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/progress)
- [Codepen](https://codepen.io/)

**Note:** It takes two approvals for entries to be merged, so I will check in later this week or tomorrow for updates.

- **OpenSauced Highlight**: [Term Entry: `<progress>`](https://github.com/Codecademy/docs/pull/2842)

## Day 2

**Update**: I got a second review on my PR for Codeacademy Docs. I just needed to revise some typos and use one of the examples I created to make it more applicable to how developers and tech professionals who code actually use this element in their daily work.
Want to see more, check out [the previous journal entry](https://github.com/CBID2/100-Days-of-Open-Source/blob/main/progress-tracker.md#day-1).

- **Project**: [LinksHub](https://www.linkshub.dev/)

- **Description**:  I co-maintain this project with [Rupali Haldiya](https://github.com/rupali-codes). It's a website that provides developers and other tech professionals with free resources to learn new or improve their tech skills.

- **Tasks completed**:
- Reviewed Pull Requests from contributors

- **Challenges faced**:
- One of the major issues I faced is solving merge conflicts. At first, I tried opening the Merge Conflict Editor in VS Code, but that did not work. So, I tried doing it in GitHub, but that led to a deployment failure warning. So, I copied the JSON file into a JSON file validator for context and then used Bard for more assistance. This is a skill that I want to improve on as the challenge progresses.

- **Resources used**:
- [Bard](https://support.google.com/bard/answer/13275745?hl=en&ref_topic=13194540&sjid=4377171688044085065-NA )

- **Challenges faced**: I had qualms about using Google Translate to help some of the files into these two languages(note: French is the language I have most familiarity with) due to the stigma that is often associated with it, but then, I remember the important thing was to be helpful. So, I only  used it if I had trouble writing certain phrases in both languages.

The maintainer pointed out that there were some YAML errors in the issue templates, so I decided to push my revision commits to my pull request template form PR.
- **Tasks completed**: I managed to make the revisions for the YAML files.
- **Challenges faced**: I struggled with fixing the errors. After reviewing the documentation and trying some YAML linters, I decided to do what I did before, look at some examples from other open source projects. By then, the errors were fixed.
- **Resources used**: [The inspiration behind the formatting of my forms](https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity/BioDrop/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug.yml). I also used [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/auth/login?iss=https%3A%2F%2Fauth0.openai.com%2F) to clean things up a bit, and my brain if errors still remained.
- **OpenSauced Highlight**: The PR got merged! 😄 [Check it out in the Highlights section](https://insights.opensauced.pizza/feed/479)! 😄 I also shared my blog post about my PR to Freecodecamp's curriculum. [Check out this highlight too!](https://insights.opensauced.pizza/feed/480) 😄

- **Project**: [opensauced/intro](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro)
- **Description**: This is a continuation of a pull request I started back in Day #30. Check out [the description in that entry](https://github.com/CBID2/100-Days-of-Open-Source/blob/main/progress-tracker.md#day-30) to learn more. One of the maintainers pointed out that the translations were not showing locally, so me and my partner,[Geoffrey Logov](https://github.com/geoffreylgv) worked on fixing those errors.
- **Tasks completed**: The issues have been fixed.
- **Challenges faced**: I had no idea why the 404 error pages kept appearing even though the syntax followed [Docsify's standards](https://docsify.js.org/#/custom-navbar). With Geoffrey's assistance, I realized that some of the files' names and pathways were labelled incorrectly.  
- **Resources used**: [Docsify's documentation for a navbar](https://docsify.js.org/#/custom-navbar) and [Geoffrey Logov's guidance](https://github.com/geoffreylgv)

## Day 60

- **Project**:  [opensauced/intro](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro)
- **Description**: The French translation of the course got merged, so today, I decided to continue with the Portuguese one.
- **Tasks completed**: I managed to add Portuguese to the translation sidebar.
- **Challenges faced**: I tried pull the new updates to the Portuguese PR, but I had no choice but to do `gut force push`, so I ended up losing the commits. While cherry picking the commits was helpful, it didn't replicate the previous translation structure. So, I downloaded the translated files to my computer, uploaded them one by one, and the structure was back. Another struggle I endured was the tabs in the custom navbar would show the syntax. I tried following Docsify's documentation for this, but it still didn't work. Hopefully, this will be solved tomorrow or over the weekend.
- **Resources used**: [Docsify's documentation for custom navbars](https://docsify.js.org/#/custom-navbar?id=markdown)

## Day 91

- **Project**: [YurisCodingClub/accessibility-mentor](https://github.com/YurisCodingClub/accessibility-mentor)

- **Description**: This is the continuation of the contribution I started on Day 88. Check out its description [here](https://github.com/CBID2/100-Days-of-Open-Source/blob/main/progress-tracker.md#day-88). Today, I wanted to make more revisions based on the maintainer's comments. [Here's an example](https://github.com/YurisCodingClub/accessibility-mentor/pull/42#issuecomment-1773992223).
- **Challenges Faced:** I was not sure how to get the footer to appear in the preview, then I took a peek at [the maintainer's first comment](https://github.com/YurisCodingClub/accessibility-mentor/pull/42#issuecomment-1772116283), added the missing footer component import, and threw in a `<footer>` tag in the `index.js` file. Things worked! :)
- **Resources used**: [The maintainer's first comment](https://github.com/YurisCodingClub/accessibility-mentor/pull/42#issuecomment-1772116283) aided me in this process.

## Day 92

- **Project**: [Accessibleforall](https://accessiblewebdev.netlify.app/)
- **Description**: This is a continuation of the contribution that I mentioned Day #90. Check it out [here](https://github.com/CBID2/100-Days-of-Open-Source/blob/main/progress-tracker.md#day-90) to get more context. Today, I wanted to work on the accessibility section of my entry on Charts.
- **Tasks completed**: I managed to add more information about how to make charts accessible, recommended resources, and create a WCAG section.
- **Challenges faced**: I had trouble describing ways people can use accessible colors for their charts. I found some resources and from there I came up with a few ideas.
- **Resources used**: My brain and [Flourish's articles on how to make charts accessible](https://flourish.studio/blog/accessible-chart-design/) 😄

## Day 93

- **Project**: [YurisCodingClub/accessibility-mentor](https://github.com/YurisCodingClub/accessibility-mentor)

- **Description**: This is the continuation of the contribution I started on Day 91. Check out its description [here](https://github.com/CBID2/100-Days-of-Open-Source/blob/main/progress-tracker.md#day-91). Today, I wanted to make more revisions based on the maintainer's comments. [Here's an example](https://github.com/YurisCodingClub/accessibility-mentor/pull/42#discussion_r1369615877).
- **Challenges Faced:** The bottom kept moving on scroll but I found a way to keep the footer at the bottom. The challenge is debating on whether to keep it centered or keep on the left(the maintainer requested for the footer to not have anymore styling). After doing mental gymnastics, I kept few parts to ensure that it stays on the left.
- **Resources used**: The maintainer recommended [this article](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decision-tree/) to learn more about creating efficient alt text.
- **OpenSauced Highlight**: I got two PRs merged today! 😄 [One is for forem, the creator of Dev.to](https://app.opensauced.pizza/feed/660) and [the other is for GitHub's docs](https://app.opensauced.pizza/feed/661).
