# 100DaysOfOSS Progress Tracker

## Day 1

- **Project**: [Codecademy Docs](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs)
- **Description of Project**: Codecademy Docs is a community-driven reference that can people can use when learning how to code or developing other tech skills.
- **Goals**: I wanted to grow my documentation skills, so I decided to improve on an entry I started writing.  
- **Tasks completed**:
The reviewer suggested that I add some text in the syntax template I created, so I used Percentage Complete so people can gain a better understanding of how to use the progress element in their projects. I also added screenshots of the coding examples I created so readers can see how the progress bar looks in a browser.
- **Challenges faced**:
- Uploading the images: I had trouble linking the screenshots to my entry
- Making the code snippets distinctive: I wanted the second example to be different and intermediate so that people who quickly learned the syntax be engaged in the entry.
- Passing one of the code tests:
- **Resources used**:
- [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/progress)
- [Codepen](https://codepen.io/)

**Note:** It takes two approvals for entries to be merged, so I will check in later this week or tomorrow for updates.

- **OpenSauced Highlight**: [Term Entry: `<progress>`](https://github.com/Codecademy/docs/pull/2842)

----

## Day 2

**Update**: I got a second review on my PR for Codeacademy Docs. I just needed to revise some typos and use one of the examples I created to make it more applicable to how developers and tech professionals who code actually use this element in their daily work.
Want to see more, check out [the previous journal entry](https://github.com/CBID2/100-Days-of-Open-Source/blob/main/progress-tracker.md#day-1).

- **Project**: [LinksHub](https://www.linkshub.dev/)

- **Description**:  I co-maintain this project with [Rupali Haldiya](https://github.com/rupali-codes). It's a website that provides developers and other tech professionals with free resources to learn new or improve their tech skills.

- **Tasks completed**:
- Reviewed Pull Requests from contributors

- **Challenges faced**:
- One of the major issues I faced is solving merge conflicts. At first, I tried opening the Merge Conflict Editor in VS Code, but that did not work. So, I tried doing it in GitHub, but that led to a deployment failure warning. So, I copied the JSON file into a JSON file validator for context and then used Bard for more assistance. This is a skill that I want to improve on as the challenge progresses.

- **Resources used**:
- [Bard](https://support.google.com/bard/answer/13275745?hl=en&ref_topic=13194540&sjid=4377171688044085065-NA )

- GDP: Create a Merge Request for my troubleshooting template
- OpenSauced: Submit a pull request that adds subfolders to the Chrome Extension section of the company's product documentation.
- **Challenges faced**:
- GDP: It took me a while to work with GitLab. I eventually got over it by reading the website's documentation and installing their workflow extension for VS Code.

- **Tasks completed**: For the writing guide, I submitted a PR that adds a section about how to use possessives effectively. For the supplementary guide, I managed to submit a PR where certain terms are omitted due to their appearance on IBM's technical documentation.  
- **Challenges faced**: Formatting was a major issue for the writing guide. XML is the main programming language for this guide. I never used this language before, so I read the patterns of the current codebase to help. Eventually, I found a way to implement the information that the maintainers requested
- **Resources used**: My brain 😄

- **Tasks completed**: I managed to translate the Glossary section and a few other files into French and Portuguese.  
- **Challenges faced**: I had qualms about using Google Translate to help some of the files into these two languages(note: French is the language I have most familiarity with) due to the stigma that is often associated with it, but then, I remember the important thing was to be helpful. So, I only  used it if I had trouble writing certain phrases in both languages.
- **Resources used**: Google Translate, my brain, and [Geoffrey Logovi](https://github.com/geoffreylgv), my writing partner.

Today (#Day 42), I was debating on whether to add my screenshots to my PR or place them in the comment section of the issue so one of the maintainers can give their feedback on them. Eventually, I decided to go with the latter because I felt it would be best to get the maintainers' approval first.
